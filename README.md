# Burano
Burano is an island in the Venetian Lagoon, northern Italy; is known for its work and brightly coloured homes.
The colours of the houses follow a specific system originating from the golden age of its development; 
if someone wishes to paint their home, one must send a request to the government, who will respond by making notice of the certain colours permitted for that lot.
